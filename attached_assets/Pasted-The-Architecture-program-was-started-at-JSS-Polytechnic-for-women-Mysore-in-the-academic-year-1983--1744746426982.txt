The Architecture program was started at JSS Polytechnic for women, Mysore in the academic year 1983-1984 to facilitate the architectural   education at diploma level. We  started  the  diploma  program  in  architecture  with  the  intake  of  20 and later  the  intake  was  enhanced  to  30 meet  the  growing  demand. The  institute  takes  very  special  care  in  selecting  students  for  admission  to  various  academic  programmes  based on  the  merit  with  the  objective  of  providing  better  technical  education. The  programme  focuses  in  training  the  students  for  acquiring  the  skills  on  drafting  and  design  development  of  various  types  of  buildings according  to  user  requirement. During  the  course  of  study , the  students  are  made  to understand  the  design  concepts  adopted  in  ancient  and modern  buildings.
